Develop Personal Doctor, a local, privacy-preserving multimodal AI assistant (text + speech + image) tailored for healthcare support (educational, advisory/triage) on a user's local Apple M4 Pro machine. It uses MedGemma as the core AI foundation model served with Ollama. Key user flows are as follows: user speaks or types a question (e.g., "I have chest pain and a mild cough"), optionally upload an image (e.g., skin lesion photo) or speak an image description, assistant responds via chat UI, optionally via voice, providing explanation, triage suggestion ("see a doctor"), and educational content, local-only inference: model and UI run on the user's MacBook, no cloud dependency for core inference. The scope of this tool is non-clinical grade (not a replacemet for a licensed physician). Must include disclaimers. The focus is on personal health education, symptom discussion, image interpretation support, and referral guidance.

Clarify
For each sample project or project that you create there should be a variable number of tasks between 5 and 15
tasks for each one randomly distributed into different states of completion. Make sure that there's at least
one task in each stage of completion.

Read the review and acceptance checklist, and check off each item in the checklist if the feature spec meets the criteria. Leave it empty if it does not.

Plan
We will develop both frontend and backend services using Python. The frontend will employ the Streamlit framework to provide a clean, user-friendly UI with minimal overhead. The backend will leverage the Agent Development Kit (ADK) from Google in Python, combined with an LLM-serving engine via Ollama and a lightweight REST API layer implemented in FastAPI. The frontend and backend will communicate via REST APIs.

I want you to go through the implementation plan and implementation details, looking for areas that could
benefit from additional research as ADK and ollama are rapidly changing libraries. 

The MedGemma model used is specifically from Ollama under the name "amsaravi/medgemma-4b-it:q6".

Now I want you to go and audit the implementation plan and the implementation detail files.
Read through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need
to be doing that are obvious from reading this. Because I don't know if there's enough here. For example,
when I look at the core implementation, it would be useful to reference the appropriate places in the implementation
details where it can find the information as it walks through each step in the core implementation or in the refinement.
