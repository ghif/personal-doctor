# Feature Specification: Streaming Text-to-Speech Output

**Feature Branch**: `004-streaming-text-to-speech`
**Created**: 2025-11-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want users able to hear the speech voice from the MedGemma's output in real-time / streaming mode while interacting with the frontend application"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Hear Real-Time Spoken Responses (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to hear the MedGemma's text output as spoken words in real-time, so that I can receive information audibly without having to read the text.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature and provides the primary user value.

**Independent Test**: The system's ability to convert text to speech and stream it to the user can be tested by providing a text input and verifying that audio is produced and played back smoothly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the user is on the chat interface,
    **When** the MedGemma model generates a text response,
    **Then** the user should hear the text being spoken in near real-time.
2.  **Given** the audio is playing,
    **When** the user navigates away from the page or closes the session,
    **Then** the audio playback should stop.

### User Story 2 - Control Audio Playback (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to be able to mute or unmute the audio output, so that I have control over when I hear the spoken responses.

**Why this priority**: Provides essential user control over the audio experience.

**Independent Test**: The mute/unmute functionality can be tested independently of the text-to-speech generation by triggering audio playback and verifying that the mute/unmute control starts and stops the sound.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the text-to-speech feature is active,
    **When** the user clicks the "Mute" button,
    **Then** no audio should be heard.
2.  **Given** the audio is muted,
    **When** the user clicks the "Unmute" button,
    **Then** the user should hear the audio output again.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the text output is very long? The audio should continue to stream without significant delays or buffering.
- How does the system handle non-alphanumeric characters or unsupported languages in the text? The system should gracefully handle these cases, either by skipping them or using a default pronunciation.
- What happens if the user's internet connection is slow or unstable? The system should attempt to buffer the audio and continue playback when the connection is restored.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST convert text generated by the MedGemma model into audible speech.
- **FR-002**: The speech MUST be streamed to the frontend application in real-time.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide controls for the user to mute and unmute the audio playback.
- **FR-004**: The audio playback MUST stop when the user session ends.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST handle various text lengths and formats gracefully.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The latency between the text being generated and the audio starting to play should be less than 2 seconds.
- **SC-002**: The audio playback should be smooth and continuous, with no more than 1 second of buffering for every 30 seconds of speech on a stable internet connection.
- **SC-003**: 95% of users should be able to successfully use the mute/unmute functionality without errors.
- **SC-004**: The feature should be successfully utilized in at least 80% of user sessions after launch.
